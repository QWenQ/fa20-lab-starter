move through B with stride   1    n    1    0    n    0
move through A with stride   n    0    n    1    0    1

Checkoff Question 1:
    for every calculation, i-ended sequences are just 0, 1, 1, which means i-ended sequeces make fully use of spatial and temporal locality;
Checkoff Question 2:
    for every calculation, j-ended sequences are just n, 0, n, which means j-ended sequeces make less use of spatial and temporal locality;
Checkoff Question 3:
    The less stride number the faster it is running.
