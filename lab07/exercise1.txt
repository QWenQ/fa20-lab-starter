Scenario 1
    1. Hit Count, Accesses
    2. 0.0
    3. Step Size, 32

Scenario 2
    1. 64
    2. MHHH
    3. 1.0

Scenario 3
    1. 0.50, 0.00, 0.33
    2. 32, 16
    3. 16
    4. get Rep Count greater than 1
    5. =, =, +, =

Checkoff Question 1: 
    we always visit 0-indexed block with different tags, in which direct mapped cache updates the data in 0-indexed block with different tags everytime. 
    So, 0.0 hit rate occurs no matter what the Rep Count is.
Checkoff Question 2: Step Size and Option
Checkoff Question 3: 
    1. M: read 4 continuous int elements [a, b, c, d] from memory into cache
    2. H: modify the value of a which has already been read in cache, write new value of a element into cache and memory
    3. H: step forward 2 int size, read the value of c in cache
    4. H: modify the value of c which has already been read in cache, write new value of c element into cache and memory
Checkoff Question 4:
    In the first loop, all data of array has been read into cache, so all accesses will be hit from the second loop. As Rep Count goes
    to infinity, hit rate equals ((infinity - 16) / infinity = ) 1.0
Checkoff Question 5: ???
Checkoff Question 6:
    After the first loop, all array data has been loaded into L2 cache, so, no miss will happen for L2 cache.
